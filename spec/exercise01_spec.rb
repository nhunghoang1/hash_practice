# A hash is a data structure that stores items by associated keys
# think of it like a dictonary, where there is a word and definition.
# In Ruby the word is called a key, and the definition is called a value.
#
# You can look up a hash using the key, i.e.
#
# For example:
# person = { :name => 'julia' }
# person[:name]
#
# Will return
# => 'julia'
#
# To pass this exercise, assign the name and age from the hash to the
# below variables

person = { :name => 'julia', :age => 1 }

name = person[:name]
age = person[:age]



# The specs to test the exercise
